<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Implementatio of [*Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2074094.2074100). 
- The dataset I have used is a subset of the movie ratings data from the Netflix Prize. 
- It contains a training set, a test set, a movies file, a dataset description file, and a README file.
- The training and test sets are both subsets of the Netflix training data. 
- The evaluation metrics I have used are the Mean Absolute Error and the Root Mean Squared Error. 
### Built With

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)


## Getting Started

Lets see how to run this program on a local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following modules 
```
1 import sys
2 import warnings
3 from math import sqrt 
4 import os
5 import numpy as np 
6 import math
7 import numpy as np
```
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shivvrat/Collaborative-Filtering.git
```
Use the main.py to run the algorithm.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Please enter the following command line argument:-
```sh
python main.py [dataset_name]
```
Please use the following command line parameters for the main.py file :-

* ***Dataset name :-***

Provide the name of folder for the dataset (please keep the folder in the same directory as the code only). Also the inside structure of the dataset folder should be same as that of given netflix folder.
